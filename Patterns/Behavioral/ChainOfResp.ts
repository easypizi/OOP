/**
 * Chain of Responsibility pattern â€” ATM dispensing example.
 *
 * Intent: Decouple sender and receivers by giving multiple objects a chance
 * to handle the request. The request is passed along a chain until a handler
 * processes it (fully or partially).
 *
 * When to use:
 * - You have multiple potential handlers for a request
 * - The handler should be determined at runtime
 * - You want to avoid tight coupling between sender and receiver
