/**
 * Strategy pattern â€” shipping rates example.
 *
 * Intent: Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them
 * interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients.
 *
 * When to use:
 * - You need to swap algorithms at runtime
 * - You want to avoid large conditional statements
